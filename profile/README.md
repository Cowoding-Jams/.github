# Cowoding-Jams
Hey! We're Antti, Lucy, Leonie, Murphy, Floschy, Amber, Wilson, Riley, Crispr, Kryal, Ian and many more! 🪺   
Together we are a group of young and mostly queer people having a game jam/hackathon Discord server called "Cowoding-Jams" together. 🌈🏳‍⚧🌿  
It all started with coding [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). Since then we had all kinds of jams.  
You can find an overview over the jams and results in the [Coding-Jams repo](https://github.com/Cowoding-Jams/Coding-Jams).
Our biggest group project so far is [Jambo](https://github.com/Cowoding-Jams/Jambo) our Discord bot to manage our whole server and make our every day life easier and more fun. Our code is made to be used by others for their own servers. Check out the wiki to find out how to use it :)
